# ComfyUI_LoRA_Sidebar
### WE'RE BACK BABY!
Not a lot of feature updates (none, actually) but it's WORKING AGAIN in ComfyUI Frontend 1.14.6 - lets hope there's not a another total refactor in 3 months üòÇ

## What is this?
A custom front-end UX node that creates a visual library of all your LoRAs. It's designed to be fast, slim, and make using LoRAs in Comfy a lot more fun for visual users - especially if you have lots of LoRAs. Should make people used to A1111 and other UI heavy platforms feel more at home. If you've got lots of LoRAs, this sidebar could be your new best friend!

## Updates
#### 11/23/24
- Wow, not even I was prepared for this update
- Added all new "Smart Info" feature, empowering your ComfyUI experience without even opening the sidebar. Game Changer ü§Ø
- Heaps of fixes and improvements
- Removed accidental dependency introduced in last version for dateutil
- Probably added a few edge case bugs, a refresh should fix any you hit (make sure to refresh if you change the category method)
- "New" category is disabled by default now since it has some edge case issues I need to fix
- Seriously though, this update is massive and totally changes the plugin
#### 11/11/24
- New visual loading indicator with some info tips
- Rewrote handling of files with bad or missing data, much more robust
- Improved sorting across the board, works like you'd expect it to now without refreshes üçæ
- Lots of small tweaks and enchancements around not needing to reload the sidebar
#### 11/09/24
- Huge update that touched almost every part of the sidebar
- Too many UX improvements to mention, tl;dr lora-info pop-up feels like new
- Tons of new settings, check out the settings page to see them all
- Brand new data handling backend, should support any number of LoRAs (10,20,30k+)
- Vastly improved lora info pop-up and image previews
- Lots of drag and drop fixes and improvements
- Added LoRA counts to categories
- Improved startup messages for those that like to watch those things üòÑ

## Features
- Sidebar that automatically generates a visual library of all your LoRA models
  - Sidebar will look for and use any existing local data, making importing super fast if you've used other plugins to download metadata previously. Supports civitai.json, stability matrix and rgthree currently
- Designed to be super fast for searches
  - Search across all aspects of LoRAs, types, tags, names, description, etc.
- Easily filter LoRAs by base model (and any search term, obviously)
- View LoRA details via LoRA Info popup, includes important model info and has easy to copy trained words and tags
- Drag and drop LoRAs to create or update LoRA nodes on the canvas
  - Drag and drop images from the LoRA Info popup to load entire workflows (if metadata exists)
- Categorize and sort your LoRAs in multiple ways such as folder structure and automatic or custom tags
- Works with custom LoRAs - Allows easy editing of LoRA details
- Provides NSFW protection for all those LoRAs that you don't remember downloading üòÅ
  - Lots of customization and options here including folder level settings 
- Battle tested with very large (9000+ models) LoRA libraries
- Supports symlinks!
- Supports video preview files, because why not
- Supports SD 3.5 and Illustrious LoRAs
- Supports local saved sha256 hashes


## Installation
### Registry / Manager
- Available in Manager, install and go!
### Manual
- `git clone` this repo into your ComfyUI custom nodes folder
  - There are no python dependencies for this node since it's front end only, you can also just download and extract the node there and I won't tell.
- Make sure to enable the new menu in the ComfyUI settings
- After install you probably want to go into Lora Sidebar Settings and configure things to your liking. If you have a very large collection and want to use categories I suggest using the collapsed default setting.
- The sidebar will automatically detect and start to process all your LoRAs when you open it. This can take a while!

*NOTE - The sidebar will process and download metadata and images from Civitai into the loraData directory within the custom node folder - but ONLY if external data doesn't already exist! This is so everything can be fast, but it does take ~1MB of space per 10 LoRAs. A collection of ~9500 LoRAs was ~1GB.*

## Usage
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32b9a961-e3a1-4d9f-bd87-6970138f1c47" height=600>

- Open the sidebar and start the initial import / process of your LoRAs
  - If you have a lot of LoRAs this can take a while. The reason this is so slow is because I've used **SAFE** rate limits for the CivitAI API. If you know where to look in the code you can change it, but I don't recommend it. The process will run the background and if you close Comfy before it finishes it will resume where it left off.
- Use the search box to quickly search for any LoRAs
  - The sidebar is fastest using no categories and just doing raw searches, I know it's not for everyone but you can give it a try.
- Filter by base model using the dropdown
- Add LoRAs to your favorites by clicking on the ‚≠ê (remove them by clicking it again)
- View LoRA details by click on the **i** button, this popup contains lots of useful data and lets you copy tags and delete LoRAs
  - Also edit almost all fields here such as name, tags, weight, etc. Great for custom LoRAs
  - Easily add images to the info slideshow and/or set custom previews
- Copy the lora trained words by using the üìã button
- Refresh LoRA details with the...refresh button
- Drag and drop the LoRA images to create a LoRA node on your canvas, or drop them on a LoRA node to update it
  - Supports Core ComfyUI nodes AND rgthree Power Loader nodes
  - Can also automatically insert A1111 style tags into prompts if you have a plugin that supports that syntax
- Use the slider at the top to quickly change the size of the LoRA Previews
- Update LoRA previews and/or data by editing the preview image and info files in the LoRA folder in the custom node's loraData folder - this is the best way to get custom LoRAs working fully and all the data is local only 
- Customize the look and feel with the settings

## Settings
This plugin has a host of settings to customize the appearence and sorting. Settings that aren't (hopefully) self explainatory have tooltips to describe how they are used. The one that most people will want to mess with here are the custom tags for sorting, if you don't use your directory structure for that. Because of the performance hit I do recommend giving it a swing with the default None and see if that does the trick, but I get browsing isn't as fun that way. Honestly if you don't have 3k+ LoRAs it really doesn't matter.

## Limitations
- Sliders don't really look great and they don't use the right node. If you have sliders and use them frequently I strongly suggest looking into my Slider Sidebar - https://github.com/Kinglord/ComfyUI_Slider_Sidebar
- This isn't a LoRA management tool so it's not made to help you manage your LoRA files
- With large datasets it can cause some timeouts, they are harmless but they do clutter the server logs a bit

## Requirements
- This is a front end plugn so you must use the new menu for to work, you can enable it in the ComfyUI settings here (Top or Bottom doesn't matter)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dcbb5f2-8a68-4ef8-8759-084a8d5af7ab)

- ComfyUI 0.1.3+
- There's no additional python requirements since it's just a frontend UI.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Custom category sorting
- [ ] Whatever bugs you find / features you submit
- [ ] Look into fixing timeouts with large datasets so the server logs don't get spammed (some of these have been fixed but there is still some websocket spam)
- [X] Investigate some ways to improve performance when using categories
- [X] Adding support for more LoRA nodes outside of ComfyUI Core - (rgthree for now)
- [X] Support A1111 style LoRA promopting
- [X] Support searching by model type (LoRA or Lycoris)
- [X] Support external data to speed up processing and reduce duplication
- [X] Fix LoRA processor from grabbing hidden system files

## Why

There have been other solutions for dealing with LoRAs visually in ComfyUI, but none of them hit the mark for me, and most of them made working with LoRAs slower than normal. I wanted something that made working with LoRAs easier and faster, without any added bloat. I actually had worked on this and stopped when I heard about the new built-in model browser. However, I used it a few days ago and I have too many LoRAs and it crashed the front end. So, I wouldn't recommend trying to use that if you have a bunch like I do. üòÑ This plugin was designed for true LoRA "power users" and to make their lives easier in ComfyUI.
